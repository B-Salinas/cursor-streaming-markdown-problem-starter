# streaming-markdown-parser

Please read this entire page.

## Task

Your task is to make a streaming Markdown parser.

Imagine that ChatGPT is streaming in chunks of Markdown text. You're writing the logic for parsing and styling that text on the fly.

Please try to get the parsing and styling logic for inline codeblocks and codeblocks working. A stretch goal would be to tackle other markdown elements (headings, italics, bold, lists).

Your code goes in `src/MarkdownParser.ts`. You should edit the last method. The starter code streams in the raw markdown with no parsing and no styling.

## Instructions for running:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

Then open `dist/index.html` in your browser

Then, to enable hot reloading:

```
npm run dev
```

## Requirements

1. Your parser should be optimistic. When you see the start of an inline code block or code block, you should immediately style the element accordingly.
   - E.g. you should immediately display `print("hello wor` instead of "\`print("hello wor."
2. While the text is streamed in, the user should be able to select the text that has already been streamed in and copy it (I.e. you cannot replace the entire HTML DOM every time).

Important: Please try to get inline codeblocks and codeblocks working. These are single backticks and triple backticks. You should ignore italics, bold, headings, etc. until you've finished this.

## What we care about

You will be evaluated on:

- Did you submit something in time?
- How much did you get done in the alotted time? Were you on the right track? Did you get inline codeblocks and codeblocks working?

We do NOT care about:

- Your CSS skills
  - Don't worry about the styling, focus on the parsing code and make sure inline codeblocks and codeblocks are visually differentiated on the screen in some way
- Code quality (mostly)
  - Please choose fast over clean
- Big o notation performance
- Getting every single edge case
  - That said, you should handle the fact that tokens can split the triple backticks. And that there can be multiple state transitions within one token (e.g. backtick, word, backtick, word, tripple backtick is a valid token)

## Other notes

- You do not need any crazy algorithms or data structures for this
- Feel free to use any tools you like (Copilot, Google, Cursor, ChatGPT)
- Don't import any dependencies
